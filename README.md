# visual-explainer

**An agent skill that turns complex terminal output into styled HTML pages you actually want to read.**

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg?style=for-the-badge)](LICENSE)

Ask your agent to explain a system architecture, review a diff, or compare requirements against a plan. Instead of ASCII art and box-drawing tables, it generates a self-contained HTML page and opens it in your browser.

```
> draw a diagram of our authentication flow
> /diff-review
> /plan-review ~/docs/refactor-plan.md
```

## EDS fork: create the idea before compiling it

This fork adds **`eds-site-designer`**, an aesthetic-first design practice for Adobe Experience Manager Edge Delivery Services.

EDS agents are already good at producing valid, authorable, performant sites. Correctness does not create taste. Visual Explainer produces stronger pages because it forms an aesthetic thesis—composition, typography, rhythm, color logic, hierarchy, and signature moments—before implementation.

The EDS skill preserves that design intelligence, then translates the approved direction into native sections, blocks, authored content, and correctly owned CSS:

```text
visual-explainer   = design director
EDS tooling        = compiler and runtime
browser critique   = fidelity gate

DIRECT -> LOCK -> COMPILE -> CRITIQUE
```

The two plugins remain separate:

| Plugin | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `visual-explainer` | General-purpose visual explanations and self-contained HTML design plates |
| `eds-site-designer` | Aesthetic direction, EDS authoring/ownership compilation, and rendered fidelity review |

The design plate is a visual source of truth, not production source. Production remains native EDS code with explicit global, section, prose, and block ownership.

## Why

Every coding agent defaults to ASCII art when you ask for a diagram. Box-drawing characters, monospace alignment hacks, text arrows. It works for trivial cases, but anything beyond a 3-box flowchart turns into an unreadable mess.

Tables are worse. Ask the agent to compare 15 requirements against a plan and you get a wall of pipes and dashes that wraps and breaks in the terminal. The data is there but it's painful to read.

This skill fixes that. Real typography, dark/light themes, interactive Mermaid diagrams with zoom and pan. Normal skill use has no build step and no dependency beyond a browser; optional MCP and PPTX utilities use small Node dependencies.

## Install

| Harness | Support | Install path / behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | Marketplace plugin | Preserved marketplace shape with source at `plugins/visual-explainer/` |
| EDS Site Designer | Claude marketplace or Agent Skills directory | Install `plugins/eds-site-designer/`; use it alongside `visual-explainer` for design plates |
| Pi | Multi-skill package metadata plus installer | `package.json` advertises both skills and their prompts plus the native `visual_explainer` design-plate tool; `install-pi.sh` remains a legacy visual-explainer-only installer |
| MCP hosts | Local stdio MCP server | `visual-explainer-mcp` exposes render tools, prompt templates, and read-only skill resources without starting an HTTP server |
| PPTX export | Best-effort static utility | `visual-explainer-pptx` converts simple HTML slide decks to `.pptx`; HTML remains the source of truth |
| Antigravity CLI | Native Agent Skills path | Copy `plugins/visual-explainer/` to `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/skills/visual-explainer` for global use or `.agents/skills/visual-explainer` for one workspace |
| Codex CLI | Native skill path plus optional prompts | Copy to `~/.codex/skills/visual-explainer`; optional prompts go in `~/.codex/prompts/` if your Codex build supports them |
| OpenCode/opencode | Observed skill/command paths | Copy to `~/.config/opencode/skill/visual-explainer`; optional commands go in `~/.config/opencode/command/` |
| Cursor | Rules-based guidance | Add the supplied `.mdc` rule; Cursor is not treated as native Agent Skills support |
| OpenClaw | Lightweight AGENTS/rules guidance | Use the supplied AGENTS guidance with the canonical skill directory |
| VS Code Copilot / Copilot CLI | Custom instructions or rules guidance | Add the supplied AGENTS guidance to your supported workspace instruction or rules setup |

**Claude Code (this fork's marketplace):**
```shell
/plugin marketplace add somarc/visual-explainer
/plugin install visual-explainer@visual-explainer-marketplace
/plugin install eds-site-designer@visual-explainer-marketplace
```

Claude Code namespaces commands as `/visual-explainer:command-name` and `/eds-site-designer:command-name`.

**Agent Skills directory:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/somarc/visual-explainer.git ~/.agents/skill-sources/visual-explainer-eds
ln -s ~/.agents/skill-sources/visual-explainer-eds/plugins/eds-site-designer ~/.agents/skills/eds-site-designer
```

Keep the existing `visual-explainer` skill installed, or link the fork's sibling plugin as well. MCP and PPTX remain capabilities of `visual-explainer`; `eds-site-designer` adds no separate runtime service.

The initial EDS integration is supported through this fork's Claude marketplace, Pi package, and generic Agent Skills directory. The later Antigravity, Codex, OpenCode, Cursor, OpenClaw, and Copilot sections remain upstream `visual-explainer` guidance; they do not yet claim tested EDS-plugin adapters.

**Pi:**
```bash
pi install git:github.com/somarc/visual-explainer
```

Or from a local checkout:
```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/somarc/visual-explainer.git
pi install ./visual-explainer
```

The package manifest advertises both skills, their command templates, and the shared Pi visual-rendering tool:

```json
"pi": {
  "extensions": ["./plugins/visual-explainer/extension.ts"],
  "skills": ["./plugins/visual-explainer", "./plugins/eds-site-designer"],
  "prompts": ["./plugins/visual-explainer/commands", "./plugins/eds-site-designer/commands"],
  "image": "./banner.png"
}
```

The Pi extension registers one native `visual_explainer` tool. Use `action: "prepare"` to plan a visual explanation after generating or reviewing a substantial plan, architecture, diff, or implementation, and `action: "render"` to write complete HTML pages to `~/.agent/diagrams/`. The opt-in `action: "render_quick"` validates a compact JSON spec and renders it with the bundled local renderer. Render actions can open with `viewer: "browser"` by default, `viewer: "glimpse"` when `glimpseui` is installed, or `viewer: "auto"` to try Glimpse and fall back to the browser. `/generate-web-diagram` remains the bundled prompt template command.

If you previously used the old curl/manual installer, remove those copied files before using `pi install`; otherwise Pi will report skill and prompt conflicts because the user-level copies shadow the package resources:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.pi/agent/skills/visual-explainer
rm -f ~/.pi/agent/prompts/{diff-review,fact-check,generate-slides,generate-visual-plan,generate-web-diagram,plan-review,project-recap}.md
rm -f ~/.pi/agent/prompts/s[h]are*.md
```

The legacy installer still works if you prefer copied skill and prompt files over package management, but it does not install the native Pi tool:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nicobailon/visual-explainer/main/install-pi.sh | bash
```

**MCP:**

Use `visual-explainer-mcp` from a package install, or run `npm install --no-package-lock` before pointing your host at `plugins/visual-explainer/mcp/server.mjs` from a checkout. Some hosts need an absolute path to the binary. The MCP server is local stdio only. It does not call an LLM, start an HTTP listener, handle credentials, or write outside `~/.agent/diagrams/`.

Example package configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "visual-explainer": {
      "command": "visual-explainer-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Example checkout configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "visual-explainer": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/visual-explainer/plugins/visual-explainer/mcp/server.mjs"]
    }
  }
}
```

The server exposes three tools: `visual_explainer_prepare`, `visual_explainer_render_html`, and `visual_explainer_render_quick`. Render tools default to `open: false`; set `open: true` only when you want the server to request a browser or Glimpse window. It also exposes the bundled command templates as MCP prompts and the canonical `SKILL.md`, command markdown, quick README, and quick schema as read-only resources.

**Antigravity CLI:**

Antigravity CLI is the supported Google successor path for consumer Gemini CLI workflows. It loads Agent Skills from `.agents/skills/` at the workspace level or `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/skills/` globally.

Global install:
```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/nicobailon/visual-explainer.git /tmp/visual-explainer

mkdir -p ~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/skills
cp -R /tmp/visual-explainer/plugins/visual-explainer ~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/skills/visual-explainer

rm -rf /tmp/visual-explainer
```

Workspace install:
```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/nicobailon/visual-explainer.git /tmp/visual-explainer

mkdir -p .agents/skills
cp -R /tmp/visual-explainer/plugins/visual-explainer .agents/skills/visual-explainer

rm -rf /tmp/visual-explainer
```

Launch `agy` in the project and use `/skills` to confirm `visual-explainer` is discovered. Ask Antigravity to use the `visual-explainer` skill for diagrams, visual reviews, slide decks, and complex tables. Antigravity SDK projects can reuse the same `SKILL.md` content as an Agent Skill resource, but this repo does not ship a separate SDK wrapper. The bundled prompt templates remain reference markdown under `plugins/visual-explainer/commands/`; no separate Antigravity plugin adapter is included.

**Codex CLI:**
```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/nicobailon/visual-explainer.git /tmp/visual-explainer

mkdir -p ~/.codex/skills ~/.codex/prompts
cp -R /tmp/visual-explainer/plugins/visual-explainer ~/.codex/skills/visual-explainer

# Optional, only if your Codex build supports prompt templates:
cp /tmp/visual-explainer/plugins/visual-explainer/commands/*.md ~/.codex/prompts/

rm -rf /tmp/visual-explainer
```

Invoke with `$visual-explainer` or ask Codex to use the `visual-explainer` skill. If prompts are installed and supported, use `/prompts:diff-review`, `/prompts:plan-review`, etc.

**OpenCode/opencode:**
```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/nicobailon/visual-explainer.git /tmp/visual-explainer

mkdir -p ~/.config/opencode/skill ~/.config/opencode/command
cp -R /tmp/visual-explainer/plugins/visual-explainer ~/.config/opencode/skill/visual-explainer

# Optional command templates:
cp /tmp/visual-explainer/plugins/visual-explainer/commands/*.md ~/.config/opencode/command/

rm -rf /tmp/visual-explainer
```

Activate it by asking OpenCode to use the `visual-explainer` skill. Command-template behavior depends on the installed OpenCode/opencode build.

**Cursor:**

Add `configs/cursor/visual-explainer.mdc` to your Cursor rules, or copy its contents into the project rules UI. This is rules-based guidance that points Cursor at the canonical skill; it does not claim native Agent Skills support.

**OpenClaw:**

Use `configs/openclaw/AGENTS.md` as lightweight project guidance and copy or reference `plugins/visual-explainer/` as the canonical skill source. No native OpenClaw plugin adapter is included.

**VS Code Copilot / Copilot CLI:**

Use `configs/copilot/AGENTS.md` as custom instructions or rules guidance. For VS Code, copy it into a supported workspace custom-instructions file, such as `.github/copilot-instructions.md`. For Copilot CLI, add it through the workspace instruction or rules setup supported by your installed version. Both read the canonical skill from `plugins/visual-explainer/`; this repository does not provide native Agent Skills support, a Copilot package, or a tested Copilot plugin adapter.

## Commands

### Visual Explainer

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/generate-web-diagram` | Generate an HTML diagram for any topic |
| `/generate-visual-plan` | Generate a visual implementation plan for a feature or extension |
| `/generate-slides` | Generate a magazine-quality slide deck |
| `/diff-review` | Visual diff review with architecture comparison and code review |
| `/plan-review` | Compare a plan against the codebase with risk assessment |
| `/project-recap` | Mental model snapshot for context-switching back to a project |
| `/fact-check` | Verify accuracy of a document against actual code |

The agent also kicks in automatically when it's about to dump a complex table in the terminal (4+ rows or 3+ columns) — it renders HTML instead.

### EDS Site Designer

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/eds-site-designer:create-eds-direction` | Inspect the project, create a specific aesthetic direction and design plate, then stop for the lock |
| `/eds-site-designer:model-eds-page` | Convert an approved direction into aesthetic invariants, authored contracts, and a CSS ownership ledger |
| `/eds-site-designer:compile-eds-page` | Implement the locked direction as native, authorable EDS source |
| `/eds-site-designer:review-eds-fidelity` | Compare the rendered page with the lock and report visual plus EDS integrity |

## Quick Mode

Add `--quick` to `/generate-web-diagram`, `/diff-review`, `/plan-review`, or `/project-recap` to ask the agent for a compact JSON spec. The bundled renderer validates the spec, escapes its content, and creates a complete self-contained HTML page. Pi uses the existing `visual_explainer` tool with `action: "render_quick"`. Other harnesses can run `plugins/visual-explainer/quick/render.mjs` locally.

Quick mode is opt-in. Commands without `--quick` keep the full custom HTML workflow. The agent also falls back to full mode when the content does not fit the quick schema or when validation or rendering fails.

```text
/generate-web-diagram --quick authentication request flow
/diff-review --quick main..HEAD
```

## Slide Deck Mode

Any command that produces a scrollable page supports `--slides` to generate a slide deck instead:

```
/diff-review --slides
/project-recap --slides 2w
```

For a portable presentation file, add `--pptx` to `/generate-slides` or run the exporter after generating an HTML deck:

```bash
visual-explainer-pptx ~/.agent/diagrams/my-deck.html ~/.agent/diagrams/my-deck.pptx
```

PPTX export is best-effort and static. It extracts titles, text, bullets, simple tables, code blocks, and Mermaid source placeholders from `<section class="slide">` elements. It does not preserve animations, reader navigation, responsive layout, custom fonts, live Mermaid/Chart.js/SVG/canvas rendering, or JavaScript behavior. Use the HTML deck for final fidelity.

## Themes

Ask for switchable themes, or name a palette, and the page gets a picker — colored dots for the palette and `Aa` chips for the font pair, both swapping live and re-rendering every Mermaid diagram:

```
"explain this pipeline, use Gruvbox"
"diagram the auth flow, let me switch themes"
```

Eleven palettes ship with it: Dracula, Nord, One Dark, Catppuccin Mocha, Tokyo Night, Gruvbox Dark, Synthwave '84 (dark) and Solarized Light, GitHub Light, Catppuccin Latte, Gruvbox Light. The font chips offer the pairs the skill already recommends. Mermaid colors and label fonts are derived from the active selection, so diagrams always match the page around them. Set `theme:` or `font:` in `visual-explainer.config.md` to choose what loads first. Claude Code users can keep personal overrides in `.claude/visual-explainer.local.md`; shared project defaults should use the harness-neutral file.

The picker is opt-in. Pages that don't ask for one still get a single palette and font pair chosen to fit the content.

```

**Output:** `~/.agent/diagrams/filename.html` → opens in browser. When you explicitly request AI-readable output or a source brief, the agent can also write `~/.agent/diagrams/filename.md` as a concise companion. It asks before replacing an existing companion. HTML remains the final visual output; the Markdown companion is not its source. In Pi package installs, agents can offer `visual_explainer` with `action: "prepare"` after generating or reviewing a substantial plan, architecture, diff, or implementation when a visual explanation would help, then call it with `action: "render"` as the final write/open step. MCP hosts use the separate `visual-explainer-mcp` stdio server and default render tools to `open: false`.

The skill routes to the right approach automatically: Mermaid for flowcharts and diagrams, CSS Grid for architecture overviews, HTML tables for data, Chart.js for dashboards.

## Limitations

- Generated HTML is portable and self-contained, but auto-opening depends on the harness, browser access, and sandbox rules.
- PPTX export is a static best-effort handoff. The HTML deck remains the source of truth for full visual fidelity.
- All harnesses write visual output to `~/.agent/diagrams/` unless the user asks for a different path.
- Switching OS theme requires a page refresh for Mermaid SVGs.
- Results vary by model capability.
- `eds-site-designer` can make aesthetic judgment more explicit and repeatable, but it does not replace human selection at the direction lock.
- EDS design plates are prototypes; production output must still be compiled into the owning EDS repository layers.
